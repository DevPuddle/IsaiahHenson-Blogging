## Getting Into API's

# What's an API?

An **application programming interface (API)** is a broad term that refers to any interface for one computer to interact or communicate with another piece of software. 

It does not have to do with the web in general but most of the time when you hear web developers use the term **API**, they're referring to **Web API’s**.

Web **API's** are interfaces that are HTTP based so when we say **API** we're referring to this interface that occurs over HTTP.

Generally the restriction that you'll run into is actually around pricing. A lot of the more useful **API's** are not always free or they have price tiers.

Grasping an understanding of **API’s** is essential, this skill is a great tool under the developers tool belt for accomplishing business needs. 

While learning JavaScript **API’s** definitely has it's own complexities. 

It’s like a puzzle piece of it's own ultimately coming together as a part of a bigger picture.

### It can be difficult concept to wrap your head around. **Embrace abstraction.**

**API's** abstract away work the developer doesn't have to worry about so you don't have to know all the intricacies.

Sometimes beginner programmers hit a road block when getting to **API’s** because they're used to patterns they developed with HTML, CSS and their intro to JavaScript. 

Running into **API's** presents a whole other pattern that has to be learned separately. 

At least for me that was the case.

### The business problem at hand is what the developer should worry about.

The business problem at hand is the programmers main concern.

Accomplishing the task and moving forward is the goal so knowing the implementation of **API's** can be enough and will save the developer a lot of time.

Understanding the **API's** syntax is of course **important** but as a beginner knowing just key parts of the **API** syntax that will get the job done will suffice. 

Making the developers life simple and business need met.
